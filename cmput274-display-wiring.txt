Wiring Description for Adafruit ILI9341 Breakout (the touchscreen display + SD).

All assignments using this board will require exactly this wiring. I strongly
suggest that you also use this wiring in your project if you use the display.

It is helpful to think of the breakout board as having three separate components:
 - The TFT display
 - The touchscreen (which lies on top of the display and has separate functions)
 - The SD card reader
Each of these has its own way of being initialized. See the code examples
included in the .zip on eClass under the 2nd block (for the Restaurant Finder).

Comments on the pins
We only wire some of the pins. Your kit should only have pins on one side.
The other side has been rendered useless. They are for a different data transfer
mode that we will not use (8 bit). In fact, we have soldered some jumpers on the
back of the board to only allow the data transfer mode we will use (SPI,
the major benefit being it uses fewer wires).

!!! CAUTION !!!
The display itself uses 3.3v logic. The pins on the breakout board that we have
soldered use 5v logic and the board has a voltage converter to interact with
the display. Follow the wiring instructions below very carefully and do not
connect anything else.


Wiring: from bottom to top on the right side (the side with the pins).

RST             NOT CONNECTED
Lite            NOT CONNECTED
Y+              A2 (analog pin)
X+              4  (digital pin)
Y-              5  (digital pin)
X-              A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS             6
CD              NOT CONNECTED

Tip: Tie together the long wires that stretch across the board to keep things
organized. I used the twist tie that came with my USB cable.
